                <p class="mx-auto text-justify text-base  ">
                    Amrita Soni’s father passed away when she was just 16 years old, just as she was preparing for the 11th grade. Being the eldest child, she had to quit her studies to take responsibility for her mother and siblings. Her mother, Urmila Soni, decided to teach her daughter the skill of sewing so that she could support the family. It was thus that she came to Sachcha Prayas.
                </p>
                <p class="mx-auto text-justify text-base  ">
                    Amrita quickly grasped the skill. With time, she saved enough money to buy a new sewing machine worth ₹6,000. She began earning between ₹1000 to ₹1500 per month by taking sewing orders from her village. With Parvez Khan’s support, she secured a sewing job at Ritu Beauty Products General Store. She now earns approximately ₹5000 per month. Moreover, she earns around ₹3000 by stitching around three sarees. Amrita has not only improved her financial condition but has also taught sewing to 15 girls in her village, empowering them to earn their livelihoods.
                </p>
                <p class="mx-auto text-justify text-base  ">
                    Her younger sister, Aarti Soni, has also learned the skill and is contributing to the family's income.

            <div class="mx-auto text-justify text-base mb-6  lg:px-12">

                <p class="mx-auto text-justify text-base  ">
                    Durgabai Sahu, 40, who lives in Hardauli Bargi Nagar gram panchayat, first faced severe financial difficulties 11 years ago when her husband, Ram Sahu suffered losses in his contracting business. He fell ill soon after and Durgabai recalls that they exhausted all their savings on his medical treatment. Durgabai enrolled in a 3-month training program at the organisation and started sewing from home using an old sewing machine. Soon, she gradually started taking on readymade garment orders. She eventually expanded her business, with four to five sewing machines at her house.                 </p>
                <p class="mx-auto text-justify text-base  ">
                    With the guidance of the organisation, she began to earn a significant income through her work on readymade garments. Eventually, she even started a small grocery shop in her neighbourhood. Durga Bai also taught sewing to some women in her neighbourhood, helping them earn a livelihood. She also trained twelve women at her workshop, who eventually found employment.
                </p>
                <p class="mx-auto text-justify text-base  ">
                    Her journey continued with the establishment of a self-help group called Bhagyalakshmi, which now includes twelve other women, all engaged in the readymade clothing business. They have also started receiving stitching orders for dresses and uniforms at the district and regional levels.

            <div class="mx-auto text-justify text-base mb-6  lg:px-12">

                <p class="mx-auto text-justify text-base  ">
                    Nuri Begum, who has never been to school, lives in the small village of Hardauli in Bargi Nagar, with her husband Sheikh Mahboob and four children. She always harboured a strong desire to do something meaningful. The first few years of marriage was one of extreme poverty. Nuri wanted to support her family, and that is how she ended up learning sewing at Sachcha Prayas.</p>
                <p class="mx-auto text-justify text-base  ">
                    Interestingly, Nuri cannot read or write, nor does she know how to take measurements or cut patterns. However, with a sharp mind for calculations, Nuri has become proficient in the field of sewing. Neha Sharma, the master trainer at Sachha Prayas, explains that Nuri would visualise things in her mind and learned to sew and embroider with precision.
                </p>
                <p class="mx-auto text-justify text-base  ">
                    Today, she earns thousands of rupees by sewing blouses, petticoats, gowns, salwar suits, and various designer attires. Nuri reveals that she has set up a flour mill in her home through the income she made by sewing. She earns around ₹8,000 to ₹10,000 rupees a month. Moreover, under the guidance of the organisation, she formed a self-help group named Sandhya Self-Help Group during the pandemic. The group soon got the opportunity to sew dresses for children from the first grade to the eighth grade through the Jabalpur District Panchayat. In the first instance, 1762 dresses were sewn and sent to the district panchayat within the 90-day deadline. This resulted in repeat orders. The group’s bank account has a deposit of ₹60,000 now, which she uses to assist the women in her group in times of need. Nuri has included approximately 15 women from her neighbourhood in her efforts, teaching them the skill of tailoring and providing them with employment.
