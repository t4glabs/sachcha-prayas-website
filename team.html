								Born into a traditional landlord family in Mankedi village, Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh,
								Parvez Khan's life took an unexpected turn due to the construction of the Bargi Dam in
								1981. The displacement his family faced transformed them from landlords to displaced
								individuals, shaping Parvez's path towards making a meaningful impact.

								After completing his degree in journalism and mass communication, Parvez chose rural
								journalism as his path. He used the media as a platform to shed light on issues related
								to water, forests, land, and displacement in rural areas. Mr. Khan also pursued a
								master's degree in rural development and decided to forgo traditional employment
								opportunities.
								Parvez often observed that rural women were engaged in labour-intensive tasks like
								collecting wood, tending to cattle, and agricultural work. This inspired him to envision
								a way to help them gain skills that would enable them to lead financially independent
								lives with dignity. Teaming up with Neha Sharma, a friend passionate about dress
								designing and women's issues, he established a training centre. Here, courses in sewing,
								embroidery, and beauty skills were offered, starting with a modest 15-women cohort
								within an Anganwadi.

								Parvez's initiative garnered attention from the Women and Child Development Department,
								marking the birth of Sachcha Prayas. This organisation aimed to uplift rural women
								through skill development and empowerment. Overcoming resource constraints, Parvez's
								unwavering determination brought to life an organisation poised to transform the lives
								of women in his community.

								Neha Sharma, a dedicated social worker, embarked on her journey in social service as a

								Together, they launched a sewing training program for women, initially starting with a

								Neha not only imparts employment-oriented training to women but actively engages other
